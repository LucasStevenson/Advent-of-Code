The chinese remainder theorem is used to solve a system of linear congruences where all the moduli are relatively coprime. What we have right now looks like this:

x = rems[0] (mod busIDs[0])
x = rems[1] (mod busIDs[1])
...
x = rems[i] (mod busIDs[i])

We can use this formula to find the solution: x = (âˆ‘(ai*Ni*Mi)) mod N
- N = product of all moduli (busIDs)
- ai = rems[i]
- Ni = N / busIDs[i]
- Mi = modinverse(Ni, busIDs[i])

    return sum([a*(N//n)*pow(N//n,-1,n) for a, n in zip(remainders, moduli)]) % N
